This is heavily modified from the original to use the HTML5 placeholder attribute instead of the value attribute. For the original plugin, check out https://github.com/Vheissu/Gravity-Forms-infield-Labels

Using it this was has browser support issues, which are somewhat resolved through the use of the html5placeholder.js plugin - http://mths.be/placeholder.

The html5placeholder.js plugin is already checked for and used (if available) within this plugin.
